# 🌿 Mental Health Sentiment Classifier

This project is a beginner-friendly **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** model that classifies emotional tone from short text inputs.  
It is more than just a model—it's a **soul-aligned offering** combining data science with emotional well-being.

## 🧠 Purpose

To gently explore how AI can recognize and support mental health expression—especially when human understanding falls short.

> *"Behind every sentence is a story. Behind every emotion is a need to be seen."*

## 📂 Dataset

A small, curated sample of emotional expressions labeled with emotions such as:
- joy
- sadness
- fear
- anger
- love
- surprise

This dataset was created manually to keep the project approachable for new learners and emotionally intentional.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer (bag-of-words)
- Logistic Regression
- Jupyter Notebook
- seaborn + matplotlib (for visualization)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Preprocess** text to lowercase
2. **Split** data into training/testing sets
3. **Vectorize** the text using bag-of-words
4. **Train** logistic regression model
5. **Evaluate** with classification report and confusion matrix

## 📊 Example Output

The model outputs emotion predictions from unseen text inputs.  
Performance is measured with precision, recall, and visualized with a heatmap of the confusion matrix.

> *Note: Because this is a small sample, metrics are for demonstration and not production-ready.*

## 💛 Creator’s Note

This project is part of a deeply personal journey to merge healing, motherhood, and purpose.  
It’s one of many steps I’m taking toward using technology to serve compassion, mental health, and human dignity.

I dedicate this work to my daughter and all souls who are learning how to be heard.
